    "title": "Open dumping near riverbank threatens aquatic life",
    "desc": "For the past two months, residents near the Tamluk riverbank have observed an increasing volume of waste being dumped directly into the water. Plastic bags, broken furniture, chemical containers, and even medical waste are being discarded without any oversight. The nearby fish population has significantly declined, and foul smells rise from the water daily. Local fishermen are losing their livelihoods as the water quality deteriorates. Despite several environmental warnings, the dumping continues. The river is turning into a toxic swamp, harming not just marine life but also people living downstream who depend on it for irrigation and daily chores. It's evident that organized dumping is happening, possibly from nearby factories and commercial units. Local activists have raised awareness, but municipal response remains absent. Without intervention, irreversible damage will occur. Residents demand strict surveillance and installation of waste filtration measures immediately to preserve the ecological balance of the river.",
